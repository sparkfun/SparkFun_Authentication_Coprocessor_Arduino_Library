# SparkFun Authentication Coprocessor Arduino Library

An Arduino library for the Auth 3.0 Coprocessor - precompiled for ESP32

This library supports the Apple Authentication 3.0 Coprocessor (MFI343S00176/77) as defined in the Accessory Interface Specification (Release R44). Unfortunately, the Interface Specification is only available under NDA. This library is precompiled for the ESP32 to protect the source code.

[Example01_BasicUsage](./examples/Example01_BasicUsage/Example01_BasicUsage.ino) demonstrates how to communicate with the Coprocessor over I<sup>2</sup>C.

This library depends on the [SparkFun Toolkit](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Toolkit) (>=1.0.6).
